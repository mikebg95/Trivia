A trivia/quiz app, whereby the user first chooses the options (number of questions, subject, difficulty, type of questions), after which the user must answer the questions. For each correct difficult question the user gets 15 points, for each medium question 10 points, and for each easy question 5 points. After finishing the quiz, the user can fill in his/her name and score, after which the highscore gets saved through a flask server.
